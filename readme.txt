== Description ==

A demo plugin utilizing new roles proposed in https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5121.

To get this plugin up and running, you'll need to apply the latest patch on https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5121, and the patch from https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6501 (until it gets committed).

To use this plugin, assign a user to the Editor role. This plugin assumes both the Administrator and Editor roles have the 'delete_others_posts' capability.

This plugin also prevents Editors from managing groups in the admin panel. No reason for this, just an example of what could be done.

While a fairly simple example, this plugin restricts Editors from managing groups in the admin panel to demonstrate some of fun that can be had by all... Super admins at least.
